# Malaria-Detection
Malaria is a deadly disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. In 2021 alone, there were an estimated 250 million cases of malaria worldwide, resulting in over 600,000 fatalities. Early detection of infected cells is critical to preventing disease progression and alerting health officials of potential outbreaks within a region.

Automating the classification of human cells as diseased or uninfected can facilitate early and accurate detection, particularly in cases where subtle indicators of disease are present. This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting malaria infection in human cells. The model will be trained on a dataset of images of infected and healthy cells, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features from the images and accurately classify them as infected or healthy. Ultimately, this tool could aid in the timely and effective diagnosis and treatment of malaria, potentially saving countless lives.
